## 📌 Purpose of the App

The main purpose of ForgeApp is to:

- Allow users to track daily **expenses** by category
- Let users record different sources of **income**
- Set **budget goals** for categories (e.g., Groceries, Transport)
- Alert users when **spending exceeds 80%** of a category budget
- Visualize actual spending via a **bar chart**

- ## 🎨 Design Considerations

### 1. **User Experience (UX)**
- Simple layout using `ConstraintLayout` and `FragmentContainerView`

## 🛠 GitHub Usage

- The source code is **hosted on GitHub**
- Each new feature is pushed to a **feature branch**

- ## ⚙️ GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
